## Challenge #6 - Selfie - Description

A new cool lending pool has launched! It's now offering flash loans of DVT tokens.

Wow, and it even includes a really fancy governance mechanism to control it.

What could go wrong, right ?

You start with no DVT tokens in balance, and the pool has 1.5 million. Your objective: take them all.

## Plan

Flash loan **and** governance mechanism... I think we already have an idea about the exploitation.

## Solution

<details>
    <summary>Description</summary>

`SelfiePool` has two functions `flashLoan`, with a check that the [borrower must be a contract](https://github.com/cRat1st0s/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry/blob/b1b61dfe28cbdd8a7f4d3b3e1b73cf2963afc750/src/Contracts/selfie/SelfiePool.sol#L42) and we will have to implement our own [`receiveTokens`](https://github.com/cRat1st0s/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry/blob/b1b61dfe28cbdd8a7f4d3b3e1b73cf2963afc750/src/Contracts/selfie/SelfiePool.sol#L43), and `drainAllFunds`, that [`onlyGovernance`](https://github.com/cRat1st0s/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry/blob/b1b61dfe28cbdd8a7f4d3b3e1b73cf2963afc750/src/Contracts/selfie/SelfiePool.sol#L50) can call it. So, we are going to abuse the `flashLoan` to somehow gain control of the governance.

`SimpleGovernance` has `queueAction`, that adds a proposal to the queue **only** [if `msg.sender` owns more than half of the total DamnValuableTokenSnapshot on the last snapshot](https://github.com/cRat1st0s/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry/blob/b1b61dfe28cbdd8a7f4d3b3e1b73cf2963afc750/src/Contracts/selfie/SimpleGovernance.sol#L92-L96).

`SimpleGovernance` has also `executeAction` that executes an action form the queue **only** [if it's the first time that is been executed **and** two days have passed](https://github.com/cRat1st0s/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry/blob/b1b61dfe28cbdd8a7f4d3b3e1b73cf2963afc750/src/Contracts/selfie/SimpleGovernance.sol#L88).

1.  Call `flashLoan` with `TOKENS_IN_POOL` from our `Attack` contract.
2.  In our `receiveTokens` trigger `snapshot` of `DamnValuableTokenSnapshot`.
3.  Call `queueAction` of `SimpleGovernance`.
4.  Pay back the loan.
5.  Fast-forward 2 days.
6.  Call `executeAction` of `SimpleGovernance`.
